# <Quintessential>

## Description

- This timed quiz project was created to utilize and better understand vanilla JavaScript, as well as practicing refining current CSS and device responsiveness knowledge.

- This project utilizes timers, event listeners, local storage, and data attributes in its functionality.


## Demo

- When the begin button is clicked a timer starts counting down with a prompt of multiple choice questions.

- When a question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds is dedcuted from the timer.

- When the timer reaches 0 or when all questions have been answered, a prompt is shown with initial input to enter into a high score board.

- When the high score board is shown a button is also presented to return to the main screen.
